## What have I done?
- Generated and hand-wrote MLIR, programatically parsed it in C++
- Tried the egg tutorial and running it
  - way simpler than MLIR, with the caveat of learning Rust

## What am I stuck on?
- Finding a more sustainable than hand-written way of generating `linalg` dialect code
  - possibly converting from a tablegen/declarative format or a c++ library
- finding a less painful way than recompiling MLIR for changes

## What am I planning to do?
- Use Jacob's advice about `linalg`
- Reach back out to Jonathan?

## What have I done?
- Compiled MLIR on my system
  - Also got the toy examples compiling
- Found note solution for my literature review
- Read the three papers I found on Scholar, tried looking for more
  - One was really interesting, the others not helpful

## What am I stuck on?
- Actually using MLIR for my own needs
  - Not terribly stuck -- just poor time management

## What am I planning to do?
- Produce something with MLIR

## What have I done?
- Read a bunch of the papers from last week
  - all seemed like good jumping off points
- Started the LLVM tutorial
  - much longer than I thought it was; I should probably skim it more

## What am I stuck on?
- Finding a good way to meaningfully summarize papers

## What am I planning to do?
- Continue working with LLVMIR
- Start looking at MLIR/the Linalg dialect
- Better collate my papers read

# 2024-01-22

## What have I done?
- Read Jonathan's paper
  - Felt approachable but also deeper than I could easily parse

## What am I stuck on?
- Unsure how much detail I need on PyTorch/BLAS
- Reading a paper and getting understanding out of methods

## What am I planning to do?
- Look into relevant papers from reference
  - [4], [20], [23]
- Read more about idiom recognition and its relation to equality saturation

- Start setting up LLVM/MLIR
  - Look at LLVMIR
